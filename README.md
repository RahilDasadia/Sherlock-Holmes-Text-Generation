Sherlock Holmes Text Generation
Overview:-
This repository contains code for training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based text generation model using Keras on the text data from "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" by Arthur Conan Doyle. The model learns to predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words in the text, enabling the generation of new text in the style of Sherlock Holmes.
